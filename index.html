          <p> Hello and welcome! My name is <b>Eva Chitul</b> and I will be your virtual host for this website. Within these humble pages
          you will find a bit of info about yours truly: the ins, the outs and a few fun facts.  </p>

          <p> To begin with, I will start with a brief background. I was born in Bistrita, a town in northern Transylvania, Romania.
            And before you ask, yes - Transylvania is awesome! I highly recommend it (post pandemic of course).  </p>

          <p> I am one of the so called <em>Children of the Revolution</em> - among those born in 1989 before the December Revolution
            took place and the Communist regime came to an end. </p>

          <p> I left Romania when I was 18, right after we joined the European Union, and went to study in the UK
            (one of the many perks the EU brought us). I followed a BA in International Relations and Politics at the University of Essex, and after graduating
           I continued with a Masters in EU International Relations and Diplomacy at the College of Europe in Bruges. </p>

           <p> After my very EU focused studies, the most logical next step was to move to the heart of all EU things - Brussels. For
             the past 10 years I have been working in EU affairs, both within consultancies as well as private companies. As part of my work I
             focused on different areas of EU legislation, including healthcare, transport, digital, electronics, consumers and environment.</p>

          <p> I am however very excited to start this new (tech) chapter in my career, and I very much look forward to meeting you and working together! In
            the meantime feel free to get in touch or to drop me a line! </p>
