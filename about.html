               <h3> Transylvania </h3>
               <p> One always wonders if the legends are true. The land of mystery, castles and a lot of
                   bad Hollywood movies - that is my Transylvania. A direct translation of the word would
                   be <em> The Land Beyond the Forest</em>. And we have a lot of those all around the
                   Carpathian mountains that surround the region. The area - due to bad politicians and a lot
                   of corruption - has not developed as it should've. On the plus side, this means
                   its <em> raw </em> feel is still intact. Definitely worth a visit for those seeking an adventure! </p>

                    <h3> Snowboarding </h3>
                    <p> A recently developed passion of mine is that for snowsports, specifically snowboarding.
                      I took up this amazing challenge quite late in my life - at the ripe age of 25 - and
                      have been hooked ever since. I am still in the beginning stages of the journey and
                      getting more confident with each ride. </p>
                    <p> The pandemic has taken a few snowboarding opportunities from us this past year, but here's to
                      hoping we will find our way back to the slopes soon! And even better, as a group if there are
                      other fellow snowsports enthusiasts among us! </p>

            <div class = 'chess-text'>
                   <h3> Chess </h3>
                   <p> I have been playing chess for as long as I can remember. The first documented photo/video
                     of this event dates back to about 1991, from my second birthday, where all eyes were focused on
                     me setting the board. Quite the event! My family has a history of chess players - both my grandfather
                   and my father. My father actually played in chess tournaments when I was little. </p>
                   <p> Sadly, I have not been consistent with chess throughout the years, but every now and then a game
                   is more than welcome. I found Netflix's <em>'The Queen's Gambit'</em> particularly interesting - and a small
                   reminder of my chess filled childhood. If you have not yet seen it, I highly recommend it! </p>

            <div class = 'kitten-text'>
                <h3> Slash </h3>
                <p> Lastly, I would like you to meet <b><em> Slash</em></b>, our little mischievous furball.
                  We got her since she was a little kitten (2 months). Her name is a fun word play on both me
                  and my partner's passion for coding and the corresponding <b>/</b>, as well as Guns 'N' Roses
                  guitarist: Slash (you know ... black hair everywhere). She has quite a personality and is polite
                   as can be - she says <em>hello</em> everytime she enters a room.</p>
                <p> I have always considered myself to be more of a dog person, but honestly,
                 there's something about cats that gets you hooked. Hopefully you will get a chance to meet her some day!</p>
