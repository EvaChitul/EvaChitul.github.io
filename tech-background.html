            <h2> Tech Background </h2>

            <div class = 'tech-text'>
               <p>My first touchpoint with programming dates back my highschool years. My major was Programming & Mathematics, and I
               spend the most part of 4 years getting familiar with <b>C++</b> and <b>C#</b>. As highschool was coming to an end, the Baccalaureate approaching
             and as I was facing the all important questions <em>What do I want to study? What do I want to do?</em> I took the decision to continue
             on a very different path for university: be adventurous, leave Romania and study something completely unheard of - International Relations. </p>

               <p>My facination with the tech world did not dissapear over the years and I often found myself wondering whether that all faithful decision
                to pursue a different path was the right one. As the years passed, the nagging feeling that I need to go back to programming intensified,
              and with that I began researching and planning a return to my coding origins. </p>

               <p>The start: the all mighty <b>Python</b>! In between reading books, attending bootcamps and following online tutorials, I felt I needed a more
                 organised and structured approach to learning, and enrolled into a afterwork/weekends course with the Informal School of IT in Romania. And then,
               <b>Switchfully</b>. </p>

               <p>I am beyong excited to begin learning Java and I look forward to a long career as a developer. </p>

               <p><em>PS: This HTML/CSS course was awesome! </em></p>
